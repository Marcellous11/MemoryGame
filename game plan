"memory game" game plan


1) i click on a card, this becomes card1 ( <div> ) and that cards color changes to the color of its .class.
    let currentCard = e.target;
    currentCard.style.backgroundColor = currentCard.classList[0];


    a place to store flipped cards. an array
    let flippedCards = []
    flippedCards.push(currentcard)

    card1 = flippedCards[0]
    card2 = flippedCards[1]

    if( card1.className === card2.className){
    numOfMatches += 2


    }else if {
    card1.style.backgroundColor = ''
    card2.style.backgroundColor = ''

    }





    2)then i chick on another card, this card becomes card2( <div> ), and it and the same thing happens.
        and if card1 !== card2 .class's,
        then both their colors !== their class










        3) but i chick on another card( <div> ), and the same thing happens. and if the firstBox and the secondBox ===
            the same .class , then += 2 is added to filledCards and the cards stayed "flipped over"



1) add booleen
2) critically learning
3) teach myself, know your blind spots 
4) no distraction while learing
learing is taking info in and letting it out
